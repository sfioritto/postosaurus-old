  <h1>Who runs this place?</h1>
  <p>
    Postosaurus is the product of Allicator, LLC. Allicator is a self-funded start
    up based in Chicago. 
  </p>

  <h1>OK, but who are you?</h1>
  <p>We are Sean and Josh.</p>
  <p>
    Sean lives lives in Chicago with his wife Beth. Sean is originally 
    from Phoenix, Arizona and disapproves of this 'winter' thing they
    have here. He is the better programmer of the two and stakes his
    claim to top nerd from there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Josh just moved to Chicago from Tucson, Arizona in the late summer
    of 2009 to work full-time on Postosaurus. He's foolishly looking
    forward to needing to wear a real coat this winter. His claim to the
    nerd throne is that the books he owns have more footnotes per
    page.

  <h1>So how can I contact these two guys?</h1>
