  <h1>How do I add a contact to my list?</h1>
  <p>
    Just send an email to your list address and CC: the person you want to add. Postosaurus will send them a confirmation email asking if they really want to be part of the list. If they accept they will be added to the list.
  </p>
  <h1>What's this 'CC:' you keep mentioning?</h1>
  <p>
    CC stands for 'carbon copy'. In your email client of choice, it should be located right below the 'To:' field. To CC: a person, just add their email in the CC: field.
  </p>
  <h1>How do I add a link to my Postosaurus link page?</h1>
  <p>
    Just send an email to the list address with the link in the message area. It doesn't need to be alone and can be part of a larger email.</p> 
    <p>Postosaurus knows what web links look like, so you don't need to do any special formatting or put codes in the subject. A simple 'Hey, this link is cool: coolthing.com' works fine.
  </p>
  <h1>I tried add some one and they accidentally declined the confirmation email. What should I do?</h1>
  <p>
    Just send another email to your Postosaurus list and CC: them again! We currently don't limit the number of times you can attempt to add somebody to a list.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do please be polite and don't spam a person who doesn't want to be in your list. Sometimes, a person just doesn't want to join your M.U.S.C.L.E.Toy.Fan@postosaurus list. We'd hate to have to put in safe guards make re-adds difficult.
   </p>
  <h1>How do I remove an address from a list?</h1>
  <p>
    Log into the Postosaurus website. You will see a list of each list you belong. Click on the 'members' link for the group you want to edit. That will take you to the 'Members' page of the list. To remove an email address, simply click the check box by the address and then click the 'Remove' button. You can also remove multiple address at the same time by clicking more than one check box. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If you accidentally remove the wrong email address, don't worry! Just add them again like you would add any email address the first time by sending an email to the list with their email address int he CC: field. If you accidentally removed your own email, you'll have to get some one still on the list to re-add you the same way.
