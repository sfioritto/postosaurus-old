  <div class="descheight">
    <p>
      Everyone sends email to a single address.
    </p>
    <p>Everyone receives it at the same email address they've been using for years.
    </p>
    <p>No more managing long lists of individual emails or wondering 
      if everybody got that important message. 
      With Postosaurus add-ons, you can even share links and archive documents. Just 
      attach it or write it an an email to the list.
    </p>
  </div>

<div id="files" class="extras">
  <h1><span class="hilight">Free</span> for the email list.</h1>
  <div class="descheight">	    
    <p>
      The base email list is free, forever. 
    </p>
    <p>
      That includes unlimited members for your list.
    </p>
    <p>The email list is an email address that everyone can use to talk with 
      everyone else. Optional features have a small one-time charge.
    </p>
  </div>

<div id="tasks" class="extras">
  <h1><span class="hilight">Organize</span> your information.</h1>
  <div class="descheight">
    <p>
      If you want it to, Postosaurus can also help you manage all the 
      information and files your group generates. 
    </p>
    <p>Postosaurus can save a copy of every file that's sent to the list, 
      send reminders for to-dos, and even remember the links you send to each other. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Best part is; it's easy. Attach or write it in an email and 
      Postosaurus knows what to do. No strange codes to learn or steps
      to remember.
