A Small Company for Small Businesses.
</h2>
<p>
Allicator LLC was founded in August of 2009. We create software for
small businesses. <a href="/">Postosaurus</a>, our first
product, is made with the small business owner in mind. You are the
busiest people on the planet so we made it easy to use and
learn. Your company is growing so our <a href="/plans">plans and pricing</a> grow
with you.
<h2>
The Team.

<p>
<img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}images/sean_portrait.jpg" />That would be me, Sean Fioritto. I'm the CEO and CTO, so I'm a busy
guy. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:sean@allicator.com">sean@allicator.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
I live in Chicago but I'm an Arizona native. I graduated from the University of Arizona with
B.S. in Computer Science and spent my last year on campus completing
<a href="http://entrepreneurship.eller.arizona.edu/">this nationally ranked</a> program in
entrepreneurship.
</p>
<p>
After college I spent a few years working at <a href="http://www.accenture.com">Accenture</a> helping Fortune 500
companies deploy <a href="http://www.sap.com">SAP</a>. Spend a few
years using and deploying enterprise software and you either lose
your faith in humanity or decide you can do better. I decided small
businesses deserved better, so I started Allicator LLC.
