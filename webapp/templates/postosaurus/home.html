    If you know how to use email, you know how to use Postosaurus.
    </h2>
    <h3>
    Postosaurus uses a private email list to track your project's communications, files, links and tasks.
    </h3>
    <p>
    It's easy to use and takes minutes to get started.

      <h2>Email</h2>
      <p>Use one email address to communicate with your entire group. Every email is stored in a searchable archive.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <h2>Files</h2>
      <p>
      All files emailed to your group are automatically uploaded, backed up and stored in your group's web site. You will always know the most recent version of a file. Never lose a file again.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <h2>Links</h2>
      <p>
      Email a link of interest to your group and Postosaurus will remember that link and store it where anyone in the group can easily find it later. No more fruitless searching for "that link you sent."
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <h2>Tasks -- Coming soon!</h2>
      <p>
      Have you ever emailed yourself a task to do later? Or sent an email asking someone to complete a task you are waiting on? Postosaurus builds task lists using these emails automatically. View all of your group's tasks from one place on your web site without losing the convenience of using email.

  <h2>
  Do I need to create a new email account?
  </h2>
  <p>
  No, you do not need to create a new email account. When you create a Postosaurus group you get a private email list for your group. You send email to that address from your email address and it goes to everyone in your group.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h2>
  Can I try it for free?
  </h2>
  <p>
  Every Postosaurus plan comes with a 15 day free trial. You can cancel at any time.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="question">
  <h2>
  If I cancel, what happens to my data?
  </h2>
  <p>
  Even if you cancel your plan you can still access your group's web site to download files and search your email archives and links. You have access to all of your data, you just can't add new links, files or send emails to your group.
  </p>

Convincing your group members to use a traditional web-based collaboration tool is a challenge. Everyone falls back on email to send versions of files or for quick communication. Why fight it? Postosaurus makes email better. Your group members never even need to sign in to the web site. To start using Postosaurus, simply send an email to the group.
