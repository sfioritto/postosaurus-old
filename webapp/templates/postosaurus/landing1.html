      <h1>What is Postosaurus?</h1>
      <p class="intro">
	Postosaurus is a lightweight project management application built
	around email. If you know how to use email, you know how to use
	Postosaurus.
      </p>
      <h1>How does it work?</h1>
      <p class="intro">
	It works like an email group. Everyone in your group uses one email
	address to talk with everyone else in the group. Plus you get tasks,
	document management and Postosaurus will even remember the links you
	send to each other.
      </p>
      <h1>Why email?</h1>
      <p class="intro">
	You've tried Microsoft Project, spreadsheets, sharing Google documents,
	and every other project	management application on the planet. But 
	everyone in your group always goes back to email. 
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
	Why fight it? Postosaurus makes email better.
      </p>
